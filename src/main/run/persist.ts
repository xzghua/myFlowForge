// after an app restart the manager only knows the WORKSPACE, not which runId was last active. Scans

// actually has a saved run2-state (skips directories from the old orchestrator, or a run whose
// controller never got past construction) and (b) has the most recently modified context.json —
// i.e. the run that was still in flight when the app died (an ended run's file also stops changing
// once its terminal emitUpdate() writes it, but ties only matter across MULTIPLE crashed runs in the
