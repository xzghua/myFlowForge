// P-C2/T1 (disk-resume): the shape RunController accepts to be reconstructed from a state loaded

//  - `inbox` (pending gate/auth/question/failure/doubt events) is never restored. Every one of
//    those events has a live Promise sitting in THIS process's `laneR`/`gateR` ResolverRegistry —
//    the old process (and its resolvers) died with the app, so a restored event could never be

//    inbox; the stage that was mid-flight (or parked awaiting a gate) simply re-runs from scratch
//    (see `sanitizeForResume` below) and raises whatever fresh events it needs this time around.
//  - `status`/`liveLanes` are always recomputed by start(), never taken from disk.
// `outcomes` IS accepted, but only in the SLIM on-disk shape persist.ts writes (id/status/project/
// error/attempts — no `result.summary`/`filesChanged`, see persist.ts's SavedOutcome) — restored
// only so `state.outcomes` (renderer history for already-`done` stages) has continuity across a
// resume. Resume's own logic never reads it back: buildPrompt's upstream() call reads
// `deps.store.getContext('artifacts:<stageKey>')` — ArtifactRef paths written by writeArtifact()
// and persisted in the SAME on-disk context.json that RunStore re-reads fresh from disk on every
