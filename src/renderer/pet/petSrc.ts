// app already uses for its other bundled images — instead of depending on the forge-pet:// custom
// protocol. That protocol serves USER-uploaded images, but as the app's only custom-scheme consumer it
// was never runtime-verified, and the default pets were showing blank (the <img> request never resolving,
// so not even the SVG fallback fired). Bundling sidesteps it entirely for the built-ins.
//
// Glob keys look like '/…/assets/pet-packs/china-dragon/png/idle.png'; match by the stored path tail.
// Built-in packs use animated WebP at runtime; PNG remains available as a static fallback/export.
// `import.meta as any`: this module is pulled into the node tsconfig too (via its own .test.ts, which
// that config globs in), and the node config lacks vite/client types — so reference glob dynamically.
