// Fixes a real bug: the P3-B temp button read `ws.stages`, which is PERMANENTLY [] for any workspace
// created/edited under the multi-workflow model — the real stages live in `ws.workflows[].stages`
// (or, if that workflow itself has none stashed, fall back to the global workflow template via
// resolveWorkflowStages). Same resolution pattern as proposeRun.ts / resumeWorkspace in handlers.ts.
